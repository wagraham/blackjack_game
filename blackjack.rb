# Wyatt's Black Jack Game

# I. Pseudo-Code

  # A. I need to create a deck of cards that contains both cases
  # and values --- The Queen  must be valued at 10, for example. 

  # B. I must somehow distribute two cards to each player, 
  # a human and a computer

  # C. the program must calculate the sum of the values, and check for 
  # 21, bust, or option to hit and stay. 

  # D. the player must go first; then the dealer must play. 

  # E. the dealer must hit unless he has at least 17.

  # F. define a winner: 21, or if one person busts (< 21), 
  # or if both stay --- the person with the closest to 21 wins. 

  # G. print the winner and score. 

# II. Replacing Logic with Ruby

#A-B
